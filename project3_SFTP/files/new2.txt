GOD'S GIFT

Love is like a river
A never ending stream.
Love is shared by each other
To answer someone's dream.

It's a never ending strory.
Love is not a lie.
You can share in all its glory,
For love will never die.

Love is all around you.
The noon and stars above.
Love is a gife from God,
And God is a gift of love.
